These quotes helped me a lot when every am stuck somewhere or don't know what to do . Am gonna list them down below and hope that they will help you as well.
  <ul>
<li> SOME PEOPLE ARE PART OF JOURNEY BUT NOT THE DESTINATION.</li> <br>
<li>ALLAH PUTS PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE FOR A REASON <br>,AND REMOVES THEM FROM YOUR LIFE
               FOR A BETTER REASON. </li><br>
<li>EVEN THE TWO HIGHEST MOUNTAINS,CANNOT STAND IN THE WAY BETWEEN <br>
              YOU AND WHAT IS MEANT TO BE YOURS. </li><br>
<li>"WHEN YOU START SEEING YOUR WORTH,<br>
  YOU WILL FIND IT HARDER TO STAY AROUND PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEE."</li<br>
