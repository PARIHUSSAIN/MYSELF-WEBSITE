<h1> HOBBIES</h1>

<h2> BEING CREATIVE IS NOT A HOBBY IT'S A WAY OF LIFE </h2>
<p>

As a young child, my dream occupation was to become a Army chief. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I want passionately pursue.<br>

It all started when my I saw my father Making his own web site a few years ago on his computer. I asked him to buy me my own computer ,I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my Dad would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, The relatively new computer industry's technology could not produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented hours creating images on my computer.<br>
<br>
As time passed by I started to it seriously I used spend so much time finding online courses and prancing at home, after doing this one course I got so much better at this that now I have made my own first webpage.<br>

I have enrolled in  web designing classes because I wish to make my hobby my career. I feel we all should do things which we enjoy doing. Everyone is running after money and in this race, they give up their likings and preferences. I have learned from this race and decided to not take part in it. I wish to take the road less traveled by and take on challenges most people donâ€™t dare to.<br>
<br>
In short, my hobby of web designing makes me feel alive and well. It is the only thing I look forward the most to. Thus, I hope to achieve my dream of being a professional web designer and making way for people who wish to make careers out of their hobbies.
